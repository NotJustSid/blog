Hey there! Welcome to yet another blog post. This one's a meta-discussion about the comment system on this blog. You see, this is a static blog. This means that stuff is fixed and there aren't any server-side thingies going on ("technically"). So some simple Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Nothing else. This is beneficial and this also has some downsides to it. It's good because the site is delivered as-is. No server-side code is executed. This makes the whole process apt and faster. At the same time, it produces difficulties in some usually wanted stuff. The one I am currently struggling with is comments.

All I could have done is just embed some code to show up some Disqus stuff and that's it. Voila! I have an awesome commenting system. The problem? Well, I imagine my commenting system to be something that feels like it belongs to this website. I don't want people to unnecessarily make accounts that they might not use at all. And on top of all that, I don't want my pages to become "slow-to-load".

So Disqus wasn't an option. I had other options, yes. The other options sometimes were paid and not a lot different from Disqus itself. Then I find Staticman. Something that I could use to make the commenting system that would be just like I wanted it to be. And where do we end up? We end up with a fairly operative comment system - except some instances wherein Staticman refuses to take any more requests and stuff, and the user ends with a Hugo error kinda screen.

The comment system is pretty much what I had planned. However, what I want is a proper notification system. I envision that the comments in my blog posts can have replies (which don't have replies, so no recursion... sorry). So obviously a person needs to know that they have received a reply. Hence the redundant E-mail (optional) section in the current system. In the future, I want to make it such that a person chooses to get replies by typing in an email in that section. The candidates for this comment system? Mailchimp et al. The problem? Well, those aren't problems to be real frank with you, but I need something that doesn't have these so-called "plans" and something which I can configure to my will.

I don't have any possible candidates. Maybe because I haven't been looking hard enough. And yes I promise I will look hard... (maybe)...

On a somewhat unrelated note, I also want to have a separate post notification system. Yes, people could go for RSS and suchlike, but I just don't know. To be frank, I haven't looked for this thing a lot (a looot).

Anyways, that's it. A short update on the situation of the blog with all its plans. See ya!
