Alright, let me be frank... things haven't been going very awesome lately.

I mean I don't even know if anyone is reading this stuff, but I will know soon and I don't care enough as I just want to share my views and stuff with the people of the world. The problem is that this blog (with the handful amount of posts it has) is becoming more of a **HOW-TO** blog, so I wanna talk about other stuff in my mind and discuss stuff I don't know how. You get the idea.

Time hasn't been going as per my plans and my plans aren't going as I would want them to.

I am currently having a ton of stuff to do and can't fetch out time properly for making this pristine blog of mine even better. I do promise however, that I will be posting a ton of stuff (all in my todo) and having a lot of fun...

BTW, comments are out now, go spam if you wanna... You can reply as well, but the problem is I haven't set up a notification system, which is also in my todo.

Also, my laptop, my primary source for writing my blogs (I don't use my PC for that) has been acting weirdly and yeah, I don't know, it crashes a lot, sometimes the boot drive is not found and more stuff, gotta check on that.

I am even writing this blog post in a hurry... Anyways, hope I write soon!!!
