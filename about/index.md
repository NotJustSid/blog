This is my Blog. Who's me, you might ask... Well, you can call me Sid. I am tech enthusiast and also love Science. In this blog, I discuss things mostly related to Maths, Computers [^1] and Science, well not biology particularly...


Go to my homepage from [here](https://sid200.github.io)

## What you might want to know:

* I probably will write one post a week or two...
* I discuss Maths, involving stuff like Calculus...
* I talk about things in a manner which communicates the essence of the topic to you...
* I love the way Physics works... And love to talk about it in a manner that would make me love it even more.
* So, well, you can expect that I would talk mostly about Physics stuff if I talk about Science...
* Please do note that I hate Biology, so don't expect me to go about discussing stuff about it...
* This is a community blog and is totally open to discussions(I am still working on the comments system...)!!!


<!-- * Optional [Disqus](http://disqus.com) comments.
