Hi there! I am Sid, and this is my blog. Of course that's evident, but yeah... What is this blog exactly? Well this blog is everything and anything I wanna talk about. It can sometimes be me ranting about something (though I haven't done that yet, but I think I will very soon) or it can just be me being me.

This is what has happened here so far:

- I made a blog for absolutely no reason other than just fun.
- I added a couple of posts in here. Now in all honesty, to me these posts aren't up to the mark yet. (Yeah I am trying to hint at a major revamp of some sort... Well to be honest, it would be more of a modification marathon, but you get the point.)
- I had some other stuff to do, so I abandoned the blog.
- Sometime in between I again took it up, made some posts, add a commenting-system, modified some more code, then left it alone again.
- Again, for absolutely no reason, we're back at it. This blog's gonna get better at whatever.
- I can't guarantee I won't lose interest again (well, I'll try to not lose interest I guess); only time can tell.

Anyways, that's the timeline, but what is this blog about again? As I said, it can be anything I like and you like (I don't really know how you would otherwise stumble upon this page...). That kinda delegates the answer and introduces a new question - *What do you like?* Uhhh, Science (minus a lot of Biology unless it's interesting and not just some mundane *learn-the-process-and-the-name* marathon) and related stuff. I don't wanna boast off, you can already see what I like (I mean I just said that I only blog about stuff I like)...

Keeping that talk aside forever, I would like to mention that this blog is by no means perfect. And ***wHiLe I aM a PeRfEcTiOnIsT***, I don't wanna make this a perfect blog - it's pretty cool with with it's flaws. Now if those flaws are bugs, then nah they're gonna go outta here - **ALWAYS COMMENT WHEREVER IF YOU FIND A BUG, AND I WILL TRY TO MAKE SURE YOU NEVER SEE IT AGAIN** (I might employ illegal methods if I can't fix it ﾍ(｀▽´*)).

Anyways, that's it for the whole about thingamajig. It wasn't about me, but more about the blog. If you wanna know more about me, go read *all* of the blog posts (*I mean it*, prolly).
