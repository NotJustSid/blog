Hi there! I am Sid, and this is my blog. Of course that's evident, but yeah... What is this blog exactly? Well this blog is everything and anything I wanna talk about. It can sometimes be me ranting about something (though I haven't done that yet), or it can just be me being me.

This is what has happened here so far:

- I made a blog just for fun.
- Added some posts and I am never satisfied with anything, so a modification marathon is underway all the time.
- I had some other stuff to do, so I abandoned the blog.
- Took it up again, added some posts, added a commenting system, left it alone.
- Envisioned to make the blog super cool and planned on a ton of posts.
- Did finish some of them, then I left the blog alone to serve to my other commitments.
- And well we're here, I kinda wanna deal with it again.

As is apparent, it's more of a *I gain interest, I write something interesting, I lose interest after a ridiculously long typing session* loop. I can't promise this will stop, but we can surely reduce the duration of each thingy, right, RIGHT?

Anyways, that's the timeline, but what is this blog about again? As I said, it can be anything I like and you like (I don't really know how you would otherwise stumble upon this page...). That kinda delegates the answer and introduces a new question - *What do you like?* Uhhh, Science (minus a lot of Biology unless it's interesting and not just some mundane *learn-the-process-and-the-name* stuff) and related stuff.

Keeping that talk aside forever, I would like to mention that this blog is by no means perfect. And ***wHiLe I aM a PeRfEcTiOnIsT***, I don't wanna make this a perfect blog - it's pretty cool with its flaws. Now if those flaws are bugs, then nah they're gonna go outta here - **ALWAYS COMMENT AS SOON AS YOU FIND A BUG, AND I WILL TRY TO MAKE SURE YOU NEVER SEE IT AGAIN** (I might employ illegal methods if I can't fix it ﾍ(｀▽´*)).

> **Future Sid:** Yeah, I can get pretty weird at times...

Anyways, that's it for the whole *About* thingamajig. It wasn't about me, but more about the blog. If you wanna know more about me, go read *all* of the blog posts (*I mean it*, prolly).
