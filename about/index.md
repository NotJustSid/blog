Hello there! My name is Siddhanth Bhowmick. Call me Sid, I will like it. This is a blog, as is evident and is mainly based on Science and Computers. It can be anything actually, revolving around what I might be wanting to talk. I can get philosophical sometimes and sometimes I just wanna talk about what annoys me the most. Sometimes I like to share with the world what I understand and sometimes I want to know what other people know about.

This is a friendly blog. All kinds of discussions with friendly fights are available here. All of that discussion happens in the comments section.

The comments section is something that I am currently still developing. It is in a good state now though. You can comment and reply to the main comments and all that stuff. What I need to do is implement a notification system. I don't know when that is going to happen and stuff, but probably soon.

I have an alternate page or my ['homepage'](https://sid200.github.io). You can check it out if you want and learn about my projects and stuff (I currently have not updated it with all my project and that is probably gonna happen a lot later, because I want to get into a stable condition and do stuff slowly, I don't wanna rush it.)

About the regularity of posts and stuff, I had previously made up my mind to post once per two weeks and stuff, but I couldn't because of time, proper stuff, text reviews and all that stuff... So, currently it is around once per month.

## What you might want to know about me:

* I will discuss Maths, involving stuff like Calculus...
* I talk about things in a manner which communicates the essence of the topic to you...
* I love the way Physics works... And love to talk about it in a manner that would make me love it even more.
* So, well, you can expect that I would talk mostly about Physics stuff if I talk about Science...
* Please do note that I don't like Biology, so don't expect me to go about discussing stuff about it...
* This is a community blog and is totally open to discussions!!!

If you find any bugs on the blog and stuff, please be sure to inform me from the comments.
